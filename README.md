# Stochastic Portfolio Optimization under Jump-Diffusion
Optimize portfolio allocation in a market where asset prices follow Mertonâ€™s Jump-Diffusion model, instead of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). or an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process.

This adds to stochastic portfolio optimization by using Merton's Jump-Diffusion model to model asset prices instead of GBM, so jumps are incoporated.

Future Prospects:

- Multi asset modeling (currently allocating between one asset and cash)
